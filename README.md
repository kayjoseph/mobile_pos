# 📱 Mobile POS Application

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many small and medium-sized businesses still rely on manual records, notebooks, or disconnected systems to manage products, sales, and expenses.  
This makes it difficult to track stock levels, monitor daily sales performance, control business expenses, and generate reliable business reports.  
As a result, business owners lack timely and accurate information for decision-making, stock planning, and financial control.

The Mobile POS application addresses this problem by providing a simple, centralized, and mobile-based system that enables business owners and attendants to manage sales operations, inventory, expenses, and business reports in one platform.
